# Vida Loca app
## 24-hour hackathon project
###### Lisbon, 12 of December 2019

A **24-hour hackathon project** developed at *<Academia de Código_>* with a randomly selected group of five people (Vitor Ferreira, Filipa Marta, Pedro Correia, Rui Luís e Nuno Correia). Our challenge was to make something inspired by Ricky Martin's song "Livin' La Vida Loca". In the end, we achieved an honorable **second place**.

##### The Idea
Our idea was to make an entertainment platform called "Vida Loca" that would enable it's users to live a second life at any time of their choosing. However, they wouldn't be able to choose which second life they would get to live even for a brief night. There would be an implicit contract: "Come in, dare to try living on the edge, be someone else you always dreamt of being for one night, giving up control for that time.". The platform would deliver extreme events based on the user's profile, generated during the user registration.

##### The Development
After an intense brainstorming, we created mockups to sketch our ideas and UX. We divide the team between frontend (Filipa Marta and Pedro Correia) vs backend (Vitor Ferreira, Rui Luís e Nuno Correia) and we started coding. The major difficulty was to persist data and making backend work (in the end we couldn't). After 24h coding work in a row, we had more 6h for final presentations to juris panel and we won second place in the hackathon. 

##### Tech && Methodologies
To organise our team work we used Lean and Scrum methodologies. For the backend we used Java, IntelliJ, Spring Web MVC, Maven. For the frontend we used HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. The design was made with Photoshop and Sketch.
